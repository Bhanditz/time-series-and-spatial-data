# Time series and spatial data
_For gathering information in preparation for a W3C Workshop and new standards work on time-series and spatial data._

Data is increasingly important to modern organisations. Time series data deals with data that changes over time, e.g. telemetry streams from industrial sensors. Spatial data relates to spatial descriptions, e.g. rooms in buildings, streets in a city, electoral wards in a region. Time series and spatial data are often found together, e.g. traffic density across transport networks, and journey data for cars, buses and trains. Whilst it is common practice to develop isolated solutions, this increases the cost and risk involved when there is a need to develop applications that combine information from multiple sources in heterogeneous silos. Open standards have the potential to dramatically boost efficiency across many sectors.

This repository is aimed at gathering information on the challenges and opportunities for the use of time series and spatial data in preparation for a W3C Workshop as a first step towards developing new standards.
